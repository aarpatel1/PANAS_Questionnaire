# PANAS Questionnaire

This project implements the **Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS)** as a web-based tool using Google Apps Script. It collects users' responses to 20 emotions, computes their Positive and Negative scores, stores the data in a Google Sheet, and displays a personalized result category.
